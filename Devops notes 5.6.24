Q. What is DevOps? 
Ans:: DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams.
It emphasizes team empowerment, cross-team communication and collaboration, and technology automation. 

Q. Cycle of DevOps?
Ans:: DevOps Lifecycle is the set of phases that includes DevOps for taking part in Development and Operation group duties for quicker software program delivery. 
DevOps follows positive techniques that consist of code, building, testing, releasing, deploying, operating, displaying, and planning. 
DevOps lifecycle follows a range of phases such as non-stop development, non-stop integration, non-stop testing, non-stop monitoring, and non-stop feedback.
Each segment of the DevOps lifecycle is related to some equipment and applied sciences to obtain the process.
Some of the frequently used tools are open source and are carried out primarily based on commercial enterprise requirements. 
DevOps lifecycle is effortless to manipulate and it helps satisfactory delivery.

Q. what is monolithic architecture and microservices?
Ans::  A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from 
other applications. The word “monolith” is often attributed to something large and glacial, 
which isn’t far from the truth of a monolith architecture for software design. A monolithic architecture is a singular, 
large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together.  To make a change to this sort of application
requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface.
This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming. 

Q. what is services in Devops?
Ans: DevOps as a service relies on infrastructure-as-code to quickly replace and address issues with virtual infrastructure.
